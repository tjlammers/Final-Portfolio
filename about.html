                <h2>About Me</h2>
            </header>
            <p>I am an Iowa native, growing up in a the Ames area. Although I lived in Cyclone country, I decided to pursue my college education
                in Iowa City. I enrolled at the University of Iowa in the fall 2020 semester. Originally, I came to Iowa as an Industrial Engineering
                major. After my first semester I started to develop a love for statistics through sports, and wanted to make that my future career.
                I changed my major to Business Analytics and Information Systems, which I partnered with a minor in Sport Recreation Management. I am
                graduating with my B.B.A. in May 2024. Next fall, I plan to futher my education by pursuing a M.B.A. from the University of Nebraska-Omaha.
            </p>
                My work experience has partnered well with my education. In the summer of 2023, I served as a Project Coordinator Intern for F&G Life in Des
                Moines. This position gave me great porfessional experience and I got to work with a fantastic team. While living in Iowa City, I worked multiple jobs
                for the University. My first position was a Student Coordinator for the Parking and Transportation team. In addition, I worked as a 
                Teaching Assistant for Financial Management 3000 during the Fall 2023 semester. Both of these positions will serve as a tremendous benefit as
                I begin the next stage of my career. All of my work experience as well as skills gained can be found in my resume below: </p>
